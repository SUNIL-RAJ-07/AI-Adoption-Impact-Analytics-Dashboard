# Project Process
## Data Collection
* Structured dataset containing AI-related business metrics
* Includes industry, country, investment, ROI, productivity, and job data
## Data Cleaning & Transformation
* Handled missing values
* Standardized numeric formats (currency, percentage, index values)
* Removed inconsistencies in category labels
* Transformed data using Power Query
## Data Modeling
* Created calculated measures using DAX
* Built KPIs:
  * Total AI Investment
  * Average AI Adoption %
  * Average ROI
  * Net Job Impact
  * Ensured proper data relationships
## Dashboard Design
* Structured layout:
* Top row → KPI cards
  * Middle row → Industry & Technology analysis
  * Bottom row → Time-based trends
* Applied professional dark corporate theme
* Added interactive slicers (Year, Country, Industry, Risk Level, Technology Type)
